# Alura-AI-Immersion-Project
This repository is my project to the Alura AI Immersion course

### Your AI-powered meeting minutes generator that saves you time and ensures accuracy.
## Never miss a detail again!

First of all, I want express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to participate in the immersion program. This program was an invaluable experience that has provided me with the skills and knowledge I need to succeed in my career. Tks Alura, Google, and FIAP

The files I used to train the model are public to view in my bucket:
 - Guidelines: https://storage.googleapis.com/lukitas-dev-storage/guidelines.txt
 - Samples: https://storage.googleapis.com/lukitas-dev-storage/samples.txt

This allows me to define what the model will do and provide it with examples of how it should function.
